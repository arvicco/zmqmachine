== 0.3.2 / 2010-08-25
  * Fixed a bug in Timers where the timers were never getting removed
    after they fired. Bug was caused by a Ruby bug with #delete_if. While
    deleting each fired timer, the delete_if loop was exited early via
    a call to #break as an optimization. The #break caused all deletes to
    be ignored.
    See bug http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/2545
  * Minor fixes to the ping-pong examples. Was missing some calls to
    register/deregister for read/write events. The socket semantics have
    changed since earlier revisions; those changes didn't get caught until
    now.

== 0.3.1 / 2010-08-16
  * Forgot to load the xreq/xrep files during startup
  * Added support for resetting a timer's firing schedule. Useful for when
    the time source has been overridden; let's existing timers
    reschedule themselves using the new time source.
  * Fixed a logic bug with delivery of multi-part messages

== 0.3.0 / 2010-08-15
  * Added XREQ/XREP socket types
  * Moved the time functions for ZM::Timers into a pair of
    class methods. Instead of accessing Time directly, it should
    be accessed via ZM::Timers.now and ZM::Timers.now_converted.
    Doing so allows the programmer to reopen the ZM::Timers class and
    redefine how time is procured if necessary (e.g. every second of
    wall clock time should translate to 1 minute of time inside the
    reactor).
  * Still needs specs!

== 0.2.0 / 2010-06-06
  * Updated internals to conform to the 0mq api as of
  release 2.0.7.

  * Minor api enhancements.

== 0.1.0 / 2010-06-02

* 1 major enhancement
  * Birthday!
