== 0.3.0 / 2010-08-15
  * Added XREQ/XREP socket types
  * Moved the time functions for ZM::Timers into a pair of
    class methods. Instead of accessing Time directly, it should
    be accessed via ZM::Timers.now and ZM::Timers.now_converted.
    Doing so allows the programmer to reopen the ZM::Timers class and
    redefine how time is procured if necessary (e.g. every second of
    wall clock time should translate to 1 minute of time inside the
    reactor).
  * Still needs specs!

== 0.2.0 / 2010-06-06
  * Updated internals to conform to the 0mq api as of
  release 2.0.7.
  
  * Minor api enhancements.

== 0.1.0 / 2010-06-02

* 1 major enhancement
  * Birthday!
